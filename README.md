## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught developer for all stacks who:
- has been programming for most of my life
- can write in ~6 languages fluently (i.e. without consulting documentation for everything)
- likes to work on metaprogramming and language design
- enjoys any kind of math
- likes to implement interesting algorithms
- generally tries to test the limits of what's possible with these silly machines
